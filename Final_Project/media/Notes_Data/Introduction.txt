Good morning, Sir.
First of all, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.
My name is Vivek Vadodariya, and I'm from Rajkot. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Darshan University.

I also completed an internship focused on the Odoo Framework of Python here in Rajkot. During my studies, 
I have hands-on experience working on .NET projects and solving problems using Java, Python, and other programming languages.

Although I don't yet have formal work experience, I'm enthusiastic about new technologies and eager to begin my career in this field.
Outside of academics, I enjoy learning about new technologies and playing chess, which helps me improve my problem-solving skills.
